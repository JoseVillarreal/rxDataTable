Data Table Directive
==========================
 
##Overview##
The `rx-data-table` directive is designed to pretty much be a catch-all
solution for displaying data in a table format in a basic or extremely
complex style. It has some basic CSS styling included, but provides hooks
for you to attach conditional styles to each row or column.
   
###Some Key Features###
- Single or Multi-Column Sorting
- Column Display Presets
- Individual Data-Driven Cell Styling
- CSS FlexBox display for fluid space display
